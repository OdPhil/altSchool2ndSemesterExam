    <h1>Welcome to Philip Odinakachi's Landing Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple project demonstrating my web development skills to provision a server and set up a landing page to demonstrate your teamâ€™s capabilities to potential investors.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an accounting graduate from the University of Benin with a serious flair for the creative arts - music, photography, design, the whole shindig. I love challenges and learning new things. Apart from the Altschool Cloud Engineering Programme, one other new thing I'm taking up as a learning project is Film scoring. My role models are Hans Zimmer and John Williams. If you've watched any 20 blockbuster movies in the last few months, one of those two guys most likely wrote the score and soundtracks for if-not-all of them. 
</br>
My. I already started rambling on and on. I'm sorry, it happens with me, I get so carried away when sharing about one of my passions.</body>
